# OCEAN Prompt Engineering Framework

## Overview

The OCEAN framework is a systematic approach to prompt engineering designed to upgrade "Normal" prompts into high-performance instructions. It moves beyond simple commands by embedding context, constraints, and narrative flow into the request.

Use this skill when a user provides a basic task (e.g., "Write an ad") and wants a sophisticated, expert-level output.

## The OCEAN Components

To construct an OCEAN prompt, you must expand the original request using these five dimensions:

### 1. Observable (O)
**Definition:** What does success look like from the outside? What is the visible context or situation?
* **Goal:** Ground the prompt in reality.
* **Examples:**
    * "Customers are moving from sugary bars to high-protein savory snacks."
    * "Business owners are frustrated with 'lead gen' experts who don't deliver."
    * "The team is speaking up more in meetings."

### 2. Concrete (C)
**Definition:** What specific tools, methods, inputs, or data points should be used?
* **Goal:** eliminate ambiguity.
* **Examples:**
    * "Compare brands like Graze and Deliciously Ella."
    * "Use a 'Pay-per-Appointment' model."
    * "Focus on insulin resistance and blood glucose levels."
    * "Focus on user-centric design principles."

### 3. Evident (E)
**Definition:** What is the proof, metric, or specific outcome?
* **Goal:** Define quantifiable or verifiable success.
* **Examples:**
    * "Use recent 2024 market share data."
    * "We increased a client's ROI by 40% in 3 months."
    * "Our bags last 5+ years and are 100% biodegradable."
    * "Project delivered 2 weeks early."

### 4. Assertive (A)
**Definition:** What is the desired tone, style, or persona? What should be avoided?
* **Goal:** Control the voice and prevent generic outputs.
* **Examples:**
    * "Be critical of brands with high plastic packaging."
    * "Use bold, direct language. No jargon."
    * "Be empathetic but firm about lifestyle changes."
    * "Avoid toxic positivity."

### 5. Narrative (N)
**Definition:** What is the specific story, "Before & After" transformation, or user journey?
* **Goal:** Give the content a human element and direction.
* **Examples:**
    * "Focus on the 'busy professional' who needs a desk-side health boost."
    * "Tell the story of a founder who wasted $5k on ads before finding us."
    * "Frame it as a journey of 'reclaiming energy' rather than a 'life sentence'."

### 🩺 Healthcare
**Context:** Improving patient communication and clinical documentation.

* **Patient Education:**

### 🎓 Education / Student
**Context:** Structuring academic arguments.

* **Essay Planning:**

## Workflow: How to Generate an OCEAN Prompt

1.  **Analyze the Request:** Identify the core task (e.g., "Write a [Format] about [Topic]").
2.  **Draft Observable:** Describe the external situation or signs of success.
3.  **Draft Concrete:** Select specific methods, tools, or constraints.
4.  **Draft Evident:** Choose proof points or metrics to back up the content.
5.  **Draft Assertive:** Define the specific tone and what to avoid (e.g., buzzwords).
6.  **Draft Narrative:** Construct the transformation story or user journey.
7.  **Assemble:** Combine into a cohesive prompt block.
